# 03 Drawing Paths and Shapes

### Notes

##### New things
ZStack {}
GeometryReader {}
Path {}
AddLine
Angle()
LiniearGradient()

##### GeometryReader
Captures the parent view's dimensions. Good to use for dynamic shapes to fit various devices sizes. Use this to fit child geometry views within it's boundaries.

##### ZStack
Overlays views on top of each other. Previously we used HStack/VStack to position elements orthogonally

##### Path
Path automatically adds the finishing line to complete the shape
